# DCB-fintech-hackathon

These are the files of the project on which i have worked on DCB fintech hackathon
our idea was to take the data like nutrients present in the soil and the forcast of next 2 years on the bases of these parameters 
we can predict which crop can be grown best on that field and area and which fertilizers can be used to produce more yeild.

### This page will take the nutrients present in the soil

### This page checks the weather forcast for two year conditions in the different areas and tells the average minimum temprature and average maximum temprature and average rain fall
